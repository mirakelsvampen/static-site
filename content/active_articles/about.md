summary: About me page

Welcome to tech.kooijman.

My name is Ben Kooijman and I work as a fulltime Cloud Architect. You can find me at the **Ops** side of DevOps but whenever I get the chance I try to gain knowledge in the **Dev** domain as much as possible. 

Here i mostly write down stuff that I have worked on, or am currently working on. I consider this website to be a personal archive of technical information that I want to remember but also share with you.

Nothing here is considered to me "mine" and feel free to take whatever information you need if you find something of use.
